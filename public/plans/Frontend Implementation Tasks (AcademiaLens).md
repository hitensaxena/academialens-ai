    *   Establish base styling approach (e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules).
2.  **User Authentication UI:**
    *   Design and implement login/signup pages.
    *   Create forms for email/password authentication.
    *   Implement UI elements for displaying authentication status (logged in/out).
    *   Integrate with backend authentication API endpoints.
    *   Implement UI for password reset functionality.
3.  **Core Document Handling UI:**
    *   Develop a dashboard or main workspace area for logged-in users.

    *   Display upload progress and handle upload errors gracefully.
    *   Create a UI for listing uploaded documents (e.g., table or card view) with basic metadata (filename, upload date).
    *   Implement UI for selecting a document for analysis.
4.  **Document Viewer Interface:**
    *   Develop a component to display processed document content (initially text extracted by backend).
    *   Implement basic navigation within the document view (scrolling).
5.  **Insight Extractor UI (Basic):**
    *   Create UI elements (e.g., sidebar, modal) to trigger and display basic summarization results (TL;DR, Abstract) from the backend API.
    *   Design and implement UI to display identified key entities and keywords, potentially highlighting them within the document view or in a separate panel.
6.  **API Integration:**
    *   Set up utility functions for making API calls to the FastAPI backend (e.g., using `fetch` or `axios`).
    *   Integrate API calls for authentication, document upload, document listing, document retrieval, and basic insight extraction features.
7.  **Basic Layout & Responsiveness:**
    *   Implement the main application layout (header, footer, sidebar, content area).
    *   Ensure basic responsiveness for common screen sizes (desktop, tablet).
8.  **Accessibility (Initial Pass):**
    *   Use semantic HTML elements.
    *   Ensure basic keyboard navigation for primary interactive elements.
    *   Add ARIA labels where necessary for clarity.

## Phase 2: Expand Core & Interaction

**Tasks:**

1.  **Insight Extractor UI (Expanded):**
    *   Implement UI controls for the ELI-PhD Suite (selecting target audience level - Layperson, Executive, PhD).
    *   Display tailored explanations generated by the backend.
    *   Develop UI for the JargonBuster: display definitions/explanations for terms/acronyms (e.g., tooltips on hover, dedicated panel).
2.  **Deconstruction Toolkit UI (Basic):**
    *   Create UI elements to trigger and display the extracted Methodology Blueprint (e.g., structured list, dedicated section).
3.  **Synthesis & Connection Hub UI (Basic):**
    *   Implement UI for selecting two documents for comparison.
    *   Develop components to display the results of the Comparative Analyzer (similarities, differences).
4.  **Interactive Q&A UI:**
    *   Design and implement a chat-like interface or input field for users to ask questions about a single document.
    *   Display answers provided by the backend API, potentially highlighting relevant sections in the document viewer.
5.  **Website URL Input UI:**
    *   Add an input field or modal for users to paste website URLs for analysis.
    *   Integrate with the backend API endpoint for URL parsing and processing.
6.  **Enhanced Document Viewer:**
    *   Improve document navigation (e.g., page numbers if applicable, better scrolling).
    *   Explore highlighting capabilities for entities, keywords, Q&A answers, etc.
7.  **Feedback Mechanism UI:**
    *   Implement simple UI elements (e.g., thumbs up/down, simple feedback form) for users to rate the quality of AI outputs.
    *   Integrate with backend endpoint for collecting feedback.
8.  **API Integration:**
    *   Integrate new API endpoints for ELI-PhD, JargonBuster, Methodology Blueprint, Comparative Analyzer, Q&A, URL input, and feedback.
9.  **Refined Responsiveness & Accessibility:**
    *   Thoroughly test and refine responsiveness across a wider range of devices (including mobile).
    *   Conduct initial WCAG compliance checks and address identified issues (color contrast, focus management).

## Phase 3: Full Suite & Advanced Inputs

**Goal:** Complete all modules, add video input, implement advanced visualizations, and refine the overall user experience.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Deconstruction Toolkit UI (Full):**
    *   Develop UI to trigger and display the Claims & Evidence Mapper (e.g., linked lists, visual graph).
    *   Implement UI for the Reproducibility Auditor, presenting highlighted factors and prompts for user consideration.
    *   Create UI for generating and displaying/downloading Quick Reference Cards.
2.  **Synthesis & Connection Hub UI (Full):**
    *   Enhance the UI to support selecting multiple documents for the Cross-Document Weaver.

    *   Integrate a library (e.g., React Flow) to visualize Conceptual Mind Maps generated by the backend.
3.  **Application & Foresight Engine UI:**
    *   Design and implement UI for the Literature Review Assistant (e.g., structured output, export options).
    *   Create UI for the Hypothesis Generator, displaying suggested hypotheses.
    *   Develop UI for the Novelty Checker, presenting comparison results.
    *   Implement UI for the Trend Analyzer & Forecaster (potentially using charting libraries).
4.  **Video Input UI:**
    *   Add UI elements for pasting video links (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.).
    *   Display transcription status and results.
    *   Integrate video analysis results into existing UI components where applicable (summarization, Q&A, etc.).
5.  **Custom Glossary Builder UI:**
    *   Implement interface for users to manage their custom glossaries (add, edit, delete terms/definitions).
    *   Integrate glossary terms into the JargonBuster feature.
6.  **Advanced Data Visualization:**
    *   Integrate charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js via React wrappers) for features like Trend Analyzer.
    *   Refine visualization components (Mind Maps, potentially Claims & Evidence graphs) for clarity and interactivity.
7.  **Collaboration Features UI (If applicable):**
    *   Design and implement UI for sharing analyses or documents with collaborators.
    *   Develop UI for collaborative annotation or discussion features (if included in scope).
8.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Analyze frontend performance using browser developer tools and Next.js analytics.
    *   Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and other optimization techniques.
    *   Optimize image loading and asset delivery.
9.  **Final Accessibility Audit & Refinement:**

    *   Address all identified accessibility issues, including complex interactions and dynamic content updates.
    *   Test thoroughly with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.
10. **Polishing & UX Refinements:**
    *   Refine animations, transitions, and micro-interactions for a polished feel.
